2015-06-12 14:30:03	jwong	thats a nice touch
2015-06-12 14:30:12	jwong	organize it better
2015-06-12 14:30:16	rdm	and then the tables I want - calling them "feats" for lack of a better name
2015-06-12 14:30:46	rdm	probably should use a better name - i already confused myself in my initial quips with you
2015-06-12 14:31:11	rdm	maybe just "table"...
2015-06-12 14:31:12	jwong	so each scenario prescribes its own table?
2015-06-12 14:31:16	jwong	table(s)
2015-06-12 14:31:58	rdm	yeah... they relate to the gherkin text (which is semi-formalized - but for our purposes I think I'd rather have someone manually convert those to test cases - going full automated would miss out good possibilities for technical review)
2015-06-12 14:33:12	jwong	right.. this is pretty cool
2015-06-12 14:33:23	rdm	My current todo on this line of thinking looks like: (1) think about names, (2) forget about it, just come up with something I can live with, (3) import tables to pg_unit db, (4) write tests
2015-06-12 14:33:44	rdm	:innocent:
2015-06-12 14:34:46	jwong	refreshing to know im not the only one who spends time on naming
2015-06-12 14:34:54	rdm	heh... you know the saying
2015-06-12 14:35:03	rdm	The two hardest problems in computer science are:
2015-06-12 14:35:07	rdm	(1) naming
2015-06-12 14:35:13	rdm	(2) cache management
2015-06-12 14:35:18	rdm	(3) off-by-one errors
2015-06-12 14:35:30	jwong	LOL dude thats 3 things
2015-06-12 14:35:36	rdm	exactly :wink:
2015-06-12 14:35:45	jwong	lulz
2015-06-12 15:09:41	walexander	@jas are we explicitly excluding mobile devices from these buys on meetme and gamefaqs?
2015-06-12 16:12:55	jas	yes, I think so

2015-06-15 08:24:25	rdm	tableau issues this morning. (1) tableau is telling me that a redshift server is failing (and does not identify which server is failing). Looking at aws console helixdwh-2-qa is in a "hardware failure" state, but none of the current scheduled tasks use that database (we used to use it for the spotx stuff, but I turned that off some time ago). So either we've got an intermittent issue here (possibly one which was fixed by someone from beanstock or aws?) or we've got a lingering configuration issue where some part of tableau holds onto configuration information which is no longer value [these possibilities are not mutually exclusive]. (2) tableau sign-in page declares: One or more of your licenses will expire on Jun 13, 2015 11:59 PM, which was last saturday. [there's also a chance that the refresh failures are somehow related to this licensing issue]
2015-06-15 08:34:09	rdm	Ah.... it is almost certainly all about the licensing. Windows Application log on the tableau server says reap extracts is failing because localhost is refusing connections.
2015-06-15 08:34:42	rdm	@akwok @jas we no longer have a functioning tableau server because the license has expired.
2015-06-15 10:39:14	walexander	the license is valid -- wher are you seeing messages about the license?
2015-06-15 10:47:28	walexander	@rdm i activated the license on the tableau server
2015-06-15 10:47:33	walexander	it's good to 2016
2015-06-15 10:52:23	walexander	@rdm getting this error when attempting to refresh ProdData: "No extracts to refresh" 
2015-06-15 10:55:19	walexander	any changes made to that recently?
2015-06-15 11:06:08	walexander	@rdm did a `tabadmin restart` and 
2015-06-15 11:06:17	walexander	it is now refreshing teh extract 
2015-06-15 11:33:13	rdm	restart makes sense
2015-06-15 11:57:41	rdm	ProdData extract finishing also helping - I've kicked off the other two "8am" extracts - I expect that that will prevent most of the "no extract" errors.
2015-06-15 12:07:02	walexander	great
2015-06-15 12:07:30	walexander	`tabadmin status -v` was showing all services as running before 
2015-06-15 12:07:47	walexander	so, consider that output suspicious
2015-06-15 12:25:25	rdm	they were running but yeah - license expiration intentionally breaks things such that "running" fails.

2015-06-18 09:53:53	rdm	DATABUS-754 wants me to set up a pipeline monitoring dashboard, so I need to think about where that fits.
2015-06-18 09:54:16	rdm	So I took a look at our currently active web servers. Here's what I see:
2015-06-18 09:54:35	rdm	@rdm uploaded a file: https://beanstock.slack.com/files/rdm/F06GNNLBU/-.tsv
2015-06-18 09:55:41	rdm	I'm thinking that, of those, the lab server is probably the best candidate for the initial implementation. But I'm open to suggestions.
2015-06-18 10:17:13	walexander	@rdm  i assigned 754 to myself.  going to do the dashboard in tableau 
2015-06-18 10:17:41	rdm	kk, looking at cucumber
2015-06-18 13:30:47	walexander	Going to be a few minutes late to the est meeting -- start without me and I'll catch up
2015-06-18 13:31:04	rdm	I'm the only one there right now
2015-06-18 13:43:13	walexander	@jas i added the `filled` table 
2015-06-18 13:44:15	walexander	I created a saved query that takes the table name and schema version as parameters: http://hive.prod.beanstock.net:8888/beeswax/execute/design/33#query

2015-06-18 16:41:23	walexander	what db name is it using?
2015-06-18 16:41:28	rdm	Hmm... looker is currently pointed at helixdwh-2-qa
2015-06-18 16:41:34	rdm	which has been down a few days
2015-06-18 16:41:45	jas	ok great, so can we bring it up?
2015-06-18 16:41:57	walexander	eh, not sure 
2015-06-18 16:42:01	rdm	might be easier to point it at a different db
2015-06-18 16:42:07	jas	which DB?
2015-06-18 16:42:11	rdm	just need one that looker can reach
2015-06-18 16:42:23	walexander	does the redshift-qa-1 where dfp reports are bbeing pushed? 
2015-06-18 16:43:04	jas	should I use that one then?
2015-06-18 16:44:07	walexander	see if it has the imported DFP reports first, but yeah use that if it does

2015-06-19 14:57:23	rdm	ok

2015-06-19 21:11:36	akwok	thanks
2015-06-19 21:12:05	walexander	you can see we have a couple of dates where redshift has more events than the others
2015-06-21 11:57:36	rdm	Hmm... looking at the importds values for only impression/request discrepancies, the hours with discrepancies look like this:
2015-06-21 11:57:50	rdm	@rdm uploaded a file: https://beanstock.slack.com/files/rdm/F06KR22DQ/-.csv
2015-06-21 11:58:53	rdm	The 2015-06-08 discrepancies are something of a special case because of structural problems in the tags on the counts. For the rest of them, it's basically just one hour every day.
2015-06-21 11:59:41	rdm	Is it possible that the adx import isn't making it into the hive counts? (That seems wrong, because kafka should be showing adx import, but that might be an instrumentation issue??)
2015-06-21 12:28:54	rdm	@rdm uploaded a file: https://beanstock.slack.com/files/rdm/F06KRC97A/-.csv and commented: Here's what redshift adx insert looks like on green... it sort of correlates but sort of does not for stuff preceding the 8th.

2015-06-22 14:50:14	walexander	the problem is that kafka and hive are only counting events 
2015-06-22 14:50:39	walexander	and redshift counts facts -- the adx import sends one event for multiple facts

2015-07-06 18:09:20	rdm	looker development session tomorrow overlaps with databus daily standup
2015-07-06 18:10:02	rdm	(unless we end looker early, which is possible, but not guaranteed)
2015-07-06 18:30:53	jas	i guess you should adjust the internal meeting if possible
2015-07-06 18:31:16	rdm	it's pato and will and i - we'll work out something
2015-06-12 14:30:03	jwong	thats a nice touch
2015-06-12 14:30:12	jwong	organize it better
2015-06-12 14:30:16	rdm	and then the tables I want - calling them "feats" for lack of a better name
2015-06-12 14:30:46	rdm	probably should use a better name - i already confused myself in my initial quips with you
2015-06-12 14:31:11	rdm	maybe just "table"...
2015-06-12 14:31:12	jwong	so each scenario prescribes its own table?
2015-06-12 14:31:16	jwong	table(s)
2015-06-12 14:31:58	rdm	yeah... they relate to the gherkin text (which is semi-formalized - but for our purposes I think I'd rather have someone manually convert those to test cases - going full automated would miss out good possibilities for technical review)
2015-06-12 14:33:12	jwong	right.. this is pretty cool
2015-06-12 14:33:23	rdm	My current todo on this line of thinking looks like: (1) think about names, (2) forget about it, just come up with something I can live with, (3) import tables to pg_unit db, (4) write tests
2015-06-12 14:33:44	rdm	:innocent:
2015-06-12 14:34:46	jwong	refreshing to know im not the only one who spends time on naming
2015-06-12 14:34:54	rdm	heh... you know the saying
2015-06-12 14:35:03	rdm	The two hardest problems in computer science are:
2015-06-12 14:35:07	rdm	(1) naming
2015-06-12 14:35:13	rdm	(2) cache management
2015-06-12 14:35:18	rdm	(3) off-by-one errors
2015-06-12 14:35:30	jwong	LOL dude thats 3 things
2015-06-12 14:35:36	rdm	exactly :wink:
2015-06-12 14:35:45	jwong	lulz
2015-06-12 15:09:41	walexander	@jas are we explicitly excluding mobile devices from these buys on meetme and gamefaqs?
2015-06-12 16:12:55	jas	yes, I think so

2015-06-15 08:24:25	rdm	tableau issues this morning. (1) tableau is telling me that a redshift server is failing (and does not identify which server is failing). Looking at aws console helixdwh-2-qa is in a "hardware failure" state, but none of the current scheduled tasks use that database (we used to use it for the spotx stuff, but I turned that off some time ago). So either we've got an intermittent issue here (possibly one which was fixed by someone from beanstock or aws?) or we've got a lingering configuration issue where some part of tableau holds onto configuration information which is no longer value [these possibilities are not mutually exclusive]. (2) tableau sign-in page declares: One or more of your licenses will expire on Jun 13, 2015 11:59 PM, which was last saturday. [there's also a chance that the refresh failures are somehow related to this licensing issue]
2015-06-15 08:34:09	rdm	Ah.... it is almost certainly all about the licensing. Windows Application log on the tableau server says reap extracts is failing because localhost is refusing connections.
2015-06-15 08:34:42	rdm	@akwok @jas we no longer have a functioning tableau server because the license has expired.
2015-06-15 10:39:14	walexander	the license is valid -- wher are you seeing messages about the license?
2015-06-15 10:47:28	walexander	@rdm i activated the license on the tableau server
2015-06-15 10:47:33	walexander	it's good to 2016
2015-06-15 10:52:23	walexander	@rdm getting this error when attempting to refresh ProdData: "No extracts to refresh" 
2015-06-15 10:55:19	walexander	any changes made to that recently?
2015-06-15 11:06:08	walexander	@rdm did a `tabadmin restart` and 
2015-06-15 11:06:17	walexander	it is now refreshing teh extract 
2015-06-15 11:33:13	rdm	restart makes sense
2015-06-15 11:57:41	rdm	ProdData extract finishing also helping - I've kicked off the other two "8am" extracts - I expect that that will prevent most of the "no extract" errors.
2015-06-15 12:07:02	walexander	great
2015-06-15 12:07:30	walexander	`tabadmin status -v` was showing all services as running before 
2015-06-15 12:07:47	walexander	so, consider that output suspicious
2015-06-15 12:25:25	rdm	they were running but yeah - license expiration intentionally breaks things such that "running" fails.

2015-06-18 09:53:53	rdm	DATABUS-754 wants me to set up a pipeline monitoring dashboard, so I need to think about where that fits.
2015-06-18 09:54:16	rdm	So I took a look at our currently active web servers. Here's what I see:
2015-06-18 09:54:35	rdm	@rdm uploaded a file: https://beanstock.slack.com/files/rdm/F06GNNLBU/-.tsv
2015-06-18 09:55:41	rdm	I'm thinking that, of those, the lab server is probably the best candidate for the initial implementation. But I'm open to suggestions.
2015-06-18 10:17:13	walexander	@rdm  i assigned 754 to myself.  going to do the dashboard in tableau 
2015-06-18 10:17:41	rdm	kk, looking at cucumber
2015-06-18 13:30:47	walexander	Going to be a few minutes late to the est meeting -- start without me and I'll catch up
2015-06-18 13:31:04	rdm	I'm the only one there right now
2015-06-18 13:43:13	walexander	@jas i added the `filled` table 
2015-06-18 13:44:15	walexander	I created a saved query that takes the table name and schema version as parameters: http://hive.prod.beanstock.net:8888/beeswax/execute/design/33#query

2015-06-18 16:40:36	jas	is the QA database down?
2015-06-18 16:40:39	jas	for Looker?
2015-06-18 16:40:45	jas	@walexander @rdm
2015-06-18 16:41:09	jas	i was in a Looker demo with the team
2015-06-18 16:41:23	walexander	what db name is it using?
2015-06-18 16:41:28	rdm	Hmm... looker is currently pointed at helixdwh-2-qa
2015-06-18 16:41:34	rdm	which has been down a few days
2015-06-18 16:41:45	jas	ok great, so can we bring it up?
2015-06-18 16:41:57	walexander	eh, not sure 
2015-06-18 16:42:01	rdm	might be easier to point it at a different db
2015-06-18 16:42:07	jas	which DB?
2015-06-18 16:42:11	rdm	just need one that looker can reach
2015-06-18 16:42:23	walexander	does the redshift-qa-1 where dfp reports are bbeing pushed? 
2015-06-18 16:43:04	jas	should I use that one then?
2015-06-18 16:44:07	walexander	see if it has the imported DFP reports first, but yeah use that if it does

2015-06-19 21:11:36	akwok	thanks
2015-06-19 21:12:05	walexander	you can see we have a couple of dates where redshift has more events than the others
2015-06-21 11:57:36	rdm	Hmm... looking at the importds values for only impression/request discrepancies, the hours with discrepancies look like this:
2015-06-21 11:57:50	rdm	@rdm uploaded a file: https://beanstock.slack.com/files/rdm/F06KR22DQ/-.csv
2015-06-21 11:58:53	rdm	The 2015-06-08 discrepancies are something of a special case because of structural problems in the tags on the counts. For the rest of them, it's basically just one hour every day.
2015-06-21 11:59:41	rdm	Is it possible that the adx import isn't making it into the hive counts? (That seems wrong, because kafka should be showing adx import, but that might be an instrumentation issue??)
2015-06-21 12:28:54	rdm	@rdm uploaded a file: https://beanstock.slack.com/files/rdm/F06KRC97A/-.csv and commented: Here's what redshift adx insert looks like on green... it sort of correlates but sort of does not for stuff preceding the 8th.

2015-06-22 14:50:14	walexander	the problem is that kafka and hive are only counting events 
2015-06-22 14:50:39	walexander	and redshift counts facts -- the adx import sends one event for multiple facts

2015-07-02 13:03:05	rdm	yep, failed on the color safety check - looks good
2015-07-02 13:04:37	pato	Ok, cool
2015-07-06 18:09:20	rdm	looker development session tomorrow overlaps with databus daily standup
2015-07-06 18:10:02	rdm	(unless we end looker early, which is possible, but not guaranteed)
2015-07-06 18:30:53	jas	i guess you should adjust the internal meeting if possible
2015-07-06 18:31:16	rdm	it's pato and will and i - we'll work out something
2015-06-12 14:30:03	jwong	thats a nice touch
2015-06-12 14:30:12	jwong	organize it better
2015-06-12 14:30:16	rdm	and then the tables I want - calling them "feats" for lack of a better name
2015-06-12 14:30:46	rdm	probably should use a better name - i already confused myself in my initial quips with you
2015-06-12 14:31:11	rdm	maybe just "table"...
2015-06-12 14:31:12	jwong	so each scenario prescribes its own table?
2015-06-12 14:31:16	jwong	table(s)
2015-06-12 14:31:58	rdm	yeah... they relate to the gherkin text (which is semi-formalized - but for our purposes I think I'd rather have someone manually convert those to test cases - going full automated would miss out good possibilities for technical review)
2015-06-12 14:33:12	jwong	right.. this is pretty cool
2015-06-12 14:33:23	rdm	My current todo on this line of thinking looks like: (1) think about names, (2) forget about it, just come up with something I can live with, (3) import tables to pg_unit db, (4) write tests
2015-06-12 14:33:44	rdm	:innocent:
2015-06-12 14:34:46	jwong	refreshing to know im not the only one who spends time on naming
2015-06-12 14:34:54	rdm	heh... you know the saying
2015-06-12 14:35:03	rdm	The two hardest problems in computer science are:
2015-06-12 14:35:07	rdm	(1) naming
2015-06-12 14:35:13	rdm	(2) cache management
2015-06-12 14:35:18	rdm	(3) off-by-one errors
2015-06-12 14:35:30	jwong	LOL dude thats 3 things
2015-06-12 14:35:36	rdm	exactly :wink:
2015-06-12 14:35:45	jwong	lulz
2015-06-12 15:09:41	walexander	@jas are we explicitly excluding mobile devices from these buys on meetme and gamefaqs?
2015-06-12 16:12:55	jas	yes, I think so

2015-06-15 08:24:25	rdm	tableau issues this morning. (1) tableau is telling me that a redshift server is failing (and does not identify which server is failing). Looking at aws console helixdwh-2-qa is in a "hardware failure" state, but none of the current scheduled tasks use that database (we used to use it for the spotx stuff, but I turned that off some time ago). So either we've got an intermittent issue here (possibly one which was fixed by someone from beanstock or aws?) or we've got a lingering configuration issue where some part of tableau holds onto configuration information which is no longer value [these possibilities are not mutually exclusive]. (2) tableau sign-in page declares: One or more of your licenses will expire on Jun 13, 2015 11:59 PM, which was last saturday. [there's also a chance that the refresh failures are somehow related to this licensing issue]
2015-06-15 08:34:09	rdm	Ah.... it is almost certainly all about the licensing. Windows Application log on the tableau server says reap extracts is failing because localhost is refusing connections.
2015-06-15 08:34:42	rdm	@akwok @jas we no longer have a functioning tableau server because the license has expired.
2015-06-15 10:39:14	walexander	the license is valid -- wher are you seeing messages about the license?
2015-06-15 10:47:28	walexander	@rdm i activated the license on the tableau server
2015-06-15 10:47:33	walexander	it's good to 2016
2015-06-15 10:52:23	walexander	@rdm getting this error when attempting to refresh ProdData: "No extracts to refresh" 
2015-06-15 10:55:19	walexander	any changes made to that recently?
2015-06-15 11:06:08	walexander	@rdm did a `tabadmin restart` and 
2015-06-15 11:06:17	walexander	it is now refreshing teh extract 
2015-06-15 11:33:13	rdm	restart makes sense
2015-06-15 11:57:41	rdm	ProdData extract finishing also helping - I've kicked off the other two "8am" extracts - I expect that that will prevent most of the "no extract" errors.
2015-06-15 12:07:02	walexander	great
2015-06-15 12:07:30	walexander	`tabadmin status -v` was showing all services as running before 
2015-06-15 12:07:47	walexander	so, consider that output suspicious
2015-06-15 12:25:25	rdm	they were running but yeah - license expiration intentionally breaks things such that "running" fails.

2015-06-18 09:53:53	rdm	DATABUS-754 wants me to set up a pipeline monitoring dashboard, so I need to think about where that fits.
2015-06-18 09:54:16	rdm	So I took a look at our currently active web servers. Here's what I see:
2015-06-18 09:54:35	rdm	@rdm uploaded a file: https://beanstock.slack.com/files/rdm/F06GNNLBU/-.tsv
2015-06-18 09:55:41	rdm	I'm thinking that, of those, the lab server is probably the best candidate for the initial implementation. But I'm open to suggestions.

2015-06-18 13:44:15	walexander	I created a saved query that takes the table name and schema version as parameters: http://hive.prod.beanstock.net:8888/beeswax/execute/design/33#query
2015-06-18 13:44:33	walexander	table name = filled, schema = current

2015-06-18 16:40:36	jas	is the QA database down?
2015-06-18 16:40:39	jas	for Looker?
2015-06-18 16:40:45	jas	@walexander @rdm
2015-06-18 16:41:09	jas	i was in a Looker demo with the team
2015-06-18 16:41:23	walexander	what db name is it using?
2015-06-18 16:41:28	rdm	Hmm... looker is currently pointed at helixdwh-2-qa
2015-06-18 16:41:34	rdm	which has been down a few days
2015-06-18 16:41:45	jas	ok great, so can we bring it up?
2015-06-18 16:41:57	walexander	eh, not sure 
2015-06-18 16:42:01	rdm	might be easier to point it at a different db
2015-06-18 16:42:07	jas	which DB?
2015-06-18 16:42:11	rdm	just need one that looker can reach
2015-06-18 16:42:23	walexander	does the redshift-qa-1 where dfp reports are bbeing pushed? 
2015-06-18 16:43:04	jas	should I use that one then?
2015-06-18 16:44:07	walexander	see if it has the imported DFP reports first, but yeah use that if it does

2015-06-19 21:11:36	akwok	thanks
2015-06-19 21:12:05	walexander	you can see we have a couple of dates where redshift has more events than the others
2015-06-21 11:57:36	rdm	Hmm... looking at the importds values for only impression/request discrepancies, the hours with discrepancies look like this:
2015-06-21 11:57:50	rdm	@rdm uploaded a file: https://beanstock.slack.com/files/rdm/F06KR22DQ/-.csv
2015-06-21 11:58:53	rdm	The 2015-06-08 discrepancies are something of a special case because of structural problems in the tags on the counts. For the rest of them, it's basically just one hour every day.
2015-06-21 11:59:41	rdm	Is it possible that the adx import isn't making it into the hive counts? (That seems wrong, because kafka should be showing adx import, but that might be an instrumentation issue??)
2015-06-21 12:28:54	rdm	@rdm uploaded a file: https://beanstock.slack.com/files/rdm/F06KRC97A/-.csv and commented: Here's what redshift adx insert looks like on green... it sort of correlates but sort of does not for stuff preceding the 8th.

2015-06-22 14:50:14	walexander	the problem is that kafka and hive are only counting events 
2015-06-22 14:50:39	walexander	and redshift counts facts -- the adx import sends one event for multiple facts

2015-07-02 13:03:05	rdm	yep, failed on the color safety check - looks good
2015-07-02 13:04:37	pato	Ok, cool
2015-07-06 18:09:20	rdm	looker development session tomorrow overlaps with databus daily standup
2015-07-06 18:10:02	rdm	(unless we end looker early, which is possible, but not guaranteed)
2015-07-06 18:30:53	jas	i guess you should adjust the internal meeting if possible
2015-07-06 18:31:16	rdm	it's pato and will and i - we'll work out something
2015-06-12 14:29:46	rdm	and that DATABUS-761 goes inside that - can have multiple tickets describing a feature
2015-06-12 14:29:51	jwong	cool that u added that databus folder in between
2015-06-12 14:29:55	rdm	then it's scenarios inside the ticket
2015-06-12 14:29:56	jwong	yeah
2015-06-12 14:30:03	jwong	thats a nice touch
2015-06-12 14:30:12	jwong	organize it better
2015-06-12 14:30:16	rdm	and then the tables I want - calling them "feats" for lack of a better name
2015-06-12 14:30:46	rdm	probably should use a better name - i already confused myself in my initial quips with you
2015-06-12 14:31:11	rdm	maybe just "table"...
2015-06-12 14:31:12	jwong	so each scenario prescribes its own table?
2015-06-12 14:31:16	jwong	table(s)
2015-06-12 14:31:58	rdm	yeah... they relate to the gherkin text (which is semi-formalized - but for our purposes I think I'd rather have someone manually convert those to test cases - going full automated would miss out good possibilities for technical review)
2015-06-12 14:33:12	jwong	right.. this is pretty cool
2015-06-12 14:33:23	rdm	My current todo on this line of thinking looks like: (1) think about names, (2) forget about it, just come up with something I can live with, (3) import tables to pg_unit db, (4) write tests
2015-06-12 14:33:44	rdm	:innocent:
2015-06-12 14:34:46	jwong	refreshing to know im not the only one who spends time on naming
2015-06-12 14:34:54	rdm	heh... you know the saying
2015-06-12 14:35:03	rdm	The two hardest problems in computer science are:
2015-06-12 14:35:07	rdm	(1) naming
2015-06-12 14:35:13	rdm	(2) cache management
2015-06-12 14:35:18	rdm	(3) off-by-one errors
2015-06-12 14:35:30	jwong	LOL dude thats 3 things
2015-06-12 14:35:36	rdm	exactly :sunglasses:
2015-06-12 14:35:45	jwong	lulz
2015-06-12 15:09:41	walexander	@jas are we explicitly excluding mobile devices from these buys on meetme and gamefaqs?
2015-06-12 16:12:55	jas	yes, I think so

2015-06-15 08:24:25	rdm	tableau issues this morning. (1) tableau is telling me that a redshift server is failing (and does not identify which server is failing). Looking at aws console helixdwh-2-qa is in a "hardware failure" state, but none of the current scheduled tasks use that database (we used to use it for the spotx stuff, but I turned that off some time ago). So either we've got an intermittent issue here (possibly one which was fixed by someone from beanstock or aws?) or we've got a lingering configuration issue where some part of tableau holds onto configuration information which is no longer value [these possibilities are not mutually exclusive .. but I also don't have enough information to know if either is factually valid]. (2) tableau sign-in page declares: One or more of your licenses will expire on Jun 13, 2015 11:59 PM, which was last saturday. [there's also a chance that the refresh failures are somehow related to this licensing issue]
2015-06-15 08:34:09	rdm	Ah.... it is almost certainly all about the licensing. Windows Application log on the tableau server says reap extracts is failing because localhost is refusing connections.
2015-06-15 08:34:42	rdm	@akwok @jas we no longer have a functioning tableau server because the license has expired.
2015-06-15 10:39:14	walexander	the license is valid -- wher are you seeing messages about the license?
2015-06-15 10:47:28	walexander	@rdm i activated the license on the tableau server
2015-06-15 10:47:33	walexander	it's good to 2016
2015-06-15 10:52:23	walexander	@rdm getting this error when attempting to refresh ProdData: "No extracts to refresh" 
2015-06-15 10:55:19	walexander	any changes made to that recently?
2015-06-15 11:06:08	walexander	@rdm did a `tabadmin restart` and 
2015-06-15 11:06:17	walexander	it is now refreshing the extract 
2015-06-15 11:33:13	rdm	restart makes sense
2015-06-15 11:57:41	rdm	ProdData extract finishing also helping - I've kicked off the other two "8am" extracts - I expect that that will prevent most of the "no extract" errors.
2015-06-15 12:07:02	walexander	great
2015-06-15 12:07:30	walexander	`tabadmin status -v` was showing all services as running before 
2015-06-15 12:07:47	walexander	so, consider that output suspicious
2015-06-15 12:25:25	rdm	they were running but yeah - license expiration intentionally breaks things such that "running" fails.

2015-06-18 09:53:53	rdm	DATABUS-754 wants me to set up a pipeline monitoring dashboard, so I need to think about where that fits.
2015-06-18 09:54:16	rdm	So I took a look at our currently active web servers. Here's what I see:
2015-06-18 09:54:35	rdm	@rdm uploaded a file: https://beanstock.slack.com/files/rdm/F06GNNLBU/-.tsv
2015-06-18 09:55:41	rdm	I'm thinking that, of those, the lab server is probably the best candidate for the initial implementation. But I'm open to suggestions.
2015-06-18 10:17:13	walexander	@rdm  i assigned 754 to myself.  going to do the dashboard in tableau 
2015-06-18 10:17:41	rdm	kk, looking at cucumber
2015-06-18 13:30:47	walexander	Going to be a few minutes late to the est meeting -- start without me and I'll catch up
2015-06-18 13:31:04	rdm	I'm the only one there right now
2015-06-18 13:43:13	walexander	@jas i added the `filled` table 
2015-06-18 13:44:15	walexander	I created a saved query that takes the table name and schema version as parameters: http://hive.prod.beanstock.net:8888/beeswax/execute/design/33#query
2015-06-18 13:44:33	walexander	table name = filled, schema = current
2015-06-18 13:44:43	-jira-	Jasanjot Singh created Bug https://beanstockmedia.atlassian.net/browse/DATABUS-765 --- 
2015-06-18 13:48:41	jas	thanks
2015-06-18 13:48:53	jas	BTW, I do not have access to that hive link
2015-06-18 13:49:05	jas	Only superusers and admin are allowed to read this document.
2015-06-18 14:08:53	walexander	oic, sorry 
2015-06-18 14:09:02	walexander	i was using a different user name
2015-06-18 14:09:03	walexander	one sec
2015-06-18 14:10:19	walexander	http://hive.prod.beanstock.net:8888/beeswax/execute/design/112#query
2015-06-18 14:10:46	walexander	but, you should see the `filled` table now 
2015-06-18 16:40:29	jas	Cannot connect: connection refused: Java::Default::PSQLException: The connection attempt failed.
2015-06-18 16:40:36	jas	is the QA database down?
2015-06-18 16:40:39	jas	for Looker?
2015-06-18 16:40:45	jas	@walexander @rdm
2015-06-18 16:41:09	jas	i was in a Looker demo with the team
2015-06-18 16:41:23	walexander	what db name is it using?
2015-06-18 16:41:28	rdm	Hmm... looker is currently pointed at helixdwh-2-qa
2015-06-18 16:41:34	rdm	which has been down a few days
2015-06-18 16:41:45	jas	ok great, so can we bring it up?
2015-06-18 16:41:57	walexander	eh, not sure 
2015-06-18 16:42:01	rdm	might be easier to point it at a different db
2015-06-18 16:42:07	jas	which DB?
2015-06-18 16:42:11	rdm	just need one that looker can reach
2015-06-18 16:42:23	walexander	is the redshift-qa-1 where dfp reports are bbeing pushed? 
2015-06-18 16:43:04	jas	should I use that one then?
2015-06-18 16:44:07	walexander	see if it has the imported DFP reports first, but yeah use that if it does

2015-06-19 21:11:36	akwok	thanks
2015-06-19 21:12:05	walexander	you can see we have a couple of dates where redshift has more events than the others
2015-06-21 11:57:36	rdm	Hmm... looking at the importds values for only impression/request discrepancies, the hours with discrepancies look like this:
2015-06-21 11:57:50	rdm	@rdm uploaded a file: https://beanstock.slack.com/files/rdm/F06KR22DQ/-.csv
2015-06-21 11:58:53	rdm	The 2015-06-08 discrepancies are something of a special case because of structural problems in the tags on the counts. For the rest of them, it's basically just one hour every day.
2015-06-21 11:59:41	rdm	Is it possible that the adx import isn't making it into the hive counts? (That seems wrong, because kafka should be showing adx import, but that might be an instrumentation issue??)
2015-06-21 12:28:54	rdm	@rdm uploaded a file: https://beanstock.slack.com/files/rdm/F06KRC97A/-.csv and commented: Here's what redshift adx insert looks like on green... it sort of correlates but sort of does not for stuff preceding the 8th.

2015-06-22 14:50:14	walexander	the problem is that kafka and hive are only counting events 
2015-06-22 14:50:39	walexander	and redshift counts facts -- the adx import sends one event for multiple facts
