2015-06-26 15:06:12	walexander	we are calling BSM['onSyncClear()'] 
2015-06-26 15:06:13	jwong	but onSyncClear should be openly available to be called
2015-06-26 15:06:26	walexander	by doing that via the timeout 
2015-06-26 15:06:56	walexander	the second impression will overwrite the current's onSyncClear
2015-06-26 15:07:07	jwong	i dont think theres any harm in that though
2015-06-26 15:07:13	jwong	i think that function is generic enough
2015-06-26 15:07:20	jwong	that if we overrode it
2015-06-26 15:07:28	walexander	we call the second impressions' onSyncClear *twice* though 
2015-06-26 15:07:35	walexander	well, we call it onc3
2015-06-26 15:07:38	walexander	and hten we undef it
2015-06-26 15:07:50	jwong	yeah and i think i see that being a bigger problem as well
2015-06-26 15:07:51	walexander	so, what happens is we count the secondi mpression 
2015-06-26 15:07:55	jwong	but not hte first
2015-06-26 15:08:05	walexander	the first imp will never get counted
2015-06-26 15:08:37	jwong	if we take out line 58
2015-06-26 15:08:57	jwong	the problem becomes then that we clear with the same impression data?
2015-06-26 15:10:48	walexander	right
2015-06-26 15:12:47	jwong	most of the time on chrome i see one auction go sync
2015-06-26 15:12:51	jwong	the other sees a cookie
2015-06-26 15:12:54	jwong	and goes async
2015-06-26 15:17:05	walexander	https://jsfiddle.net/9trgneqf/2/
2015-06-26 15:17:33	walexander	that's essentially what we're doing now -- and it should alert twice
2015-06-26 15:17:45	walexander	but only once -- then it throws `window.say is not a function`
2015-06-26 15:18:02	jwong	yeah line 58 has to go
2015-06-26 15:18:14	jwong	and i also proved that onSyncClear doesnt need to be unique
2015-06-26 15:18:21	jwong	the impression data is different
2015-06-26 15:20:04	walexander	no, line 75 has to change
2015-06-26 15:20:06	jwong	@jwong uploaded a file: <https://beanstock.slack.com/files/jwong/F06T33PCL/screen_shot_2015-06-26_at_12.17.43_pm.png|Screen Shot 2015-06-26 at 12.17.43 PM.png>
2015-06-26 15:20:44	jwong	thats with line 58 gone and nothing else
2015-06-26 15:21:01	walexander	yeah, but look how the second /request pixel fires *after* the first cleared
2015-06-26 15:21:36	walexander	set the delay to be like 10 seconds
2015-06-26 15:22:01	jwong	alright ill do this in a unit test
2015-06-26 16:42:14	jwong	lol
2015-06-26 18:22:20	walexander	will we send user_id and session_id on the request pixel?
2015-06-26 18:22:30	jwong	no just the cleared
2015-06-26 18:22:52	walexander	http://hive.prod.beanstock.net:8888/beeswax/execute/query/161#query/results
2015-06-26 18:23:02	walexander	requests without impressions 
2015-06-26 18:24:25	jwong	bnVsbAo= ?
2015-06-26 18:24:34	walexander	yeah, but shit -- fucked that up 
2015-06-26 18:24:38	walexander	that's the default id 
2015-06-26 18:34:02	walexander	check this out: http://hive.prod.beanstock.net:8888/beeswax/execute/query/164#query/results
2015-06-26 18:35:29	walexander	bunch of those look like dupes 
2015-06-26 18:36:39	jwong	what do you mean??
2015-06-26 18:37:17	walexander	if you look at the imps for ip_address 0a99e023
2015-06-26 18:37:31	walexander	and compare teh referrer url 
2015-06-26 18:37:38	walexander	it's identical 
2015-06-26 18:37:58	walexander	no way that should be happening
2015-06-26 18:38:13	walexander	but they have distinct impression_id's
2015-06-26 18:38:34	walexander	makes me think that someone is using one APN creative to deliver multiple ads
2015-06-26 18:39:42	jwong	hmm
2015-06-26 18:39:49	walexander	http://hive.prod.beanstock.net:8888/beeswax/execute/query/164#query/results

2015-06-26 18:41:01	walexander	yeah, maybe you're right though 
2015-06-26 18:42:09	walexander	0a99e023 is a fucking 10.x IP 
2015-06-26 18:44:27	jwong	work computers ?
2015-06-26 18:44:38	walexander	should still be sent to us
2015-06-26 18:44:58	jwong	:robots:

2015-06-26 18:47:57	walexander	are these three referers duplicates? http://hive.prod.beanstock.net:8888/beeswax/execute/query/168#query/results
2015-06-26 18:49:11	jwong	hmm
2015-06-26 18:49:22	jwong	at glance they look like it
2015-06-26 18:49:31	jwong	usually you can notice a change in sequence pretty easily

2015-06-26 18:55:09	walexander	i can't imagine they're *not* monetizing it 
2015-06-26 18:55:35	jwong	so they got APN tags
2015-06-26 18:55:42	jwong	filling somewhere on their UI
2015-06-26 18:55:55	jwong	apn is a POS lol
2015-06-26 18:56:16	jwong	or is it adshoard
2015-06-26 18:58:06	jwong	well i better start optimizing for our Amigo
2015-06-26 18:58:21	walexander	it's not adshoard
2015-06-26 21:38:04	jwong	```
2015-06-26 21:38:04		        BSM['onSyncClear'] = function(price) {

2015-06-26 21:38:04		        }
2015-06-26 21:38:04		```
2015-06-26 21:38:34	jwong	if we can assume that the first scheduled cleared is the earliest onSyncClear() to fire
2015-06-26 21:38:48	jwong	then i think i got it dude
2015-06-29 12:44:37	jwong	:disappointed:
2015-06-29 13:06:56	walexander	?
2015-06-29 13:07:36	jwong	nothin just saw u cancelled all the meetings
2015-06-29 13:08:11	jwong	i vaguely remember u saying something u were gonna be out on vacay during this time?

2015-07-02 16:16:36	walexander	feeding sadie these days is like caring for a geriatric patient
2015-07-02 16:17:04	jwong	she wont eat ?
2015-07-02 16:17:28	walexander	shirley's instructions: ``` SHe gets  .... 3 tramamil 1 gabapentin and 2 fish oils and the rest of the can above the sink. Mix. Serve.  ```
2015-07-02 16:17:44	walexander	hah, no, she eats just fine
2015-07-02 16:18:25	walexander	she's on these pain killers (3 tramamil) that are evidently highly regulated
2015-07-02 16:18:35	jwong	haha i just googled it
2015-07-02 16:18:38	jwong	poor girl man
2015-07-02 16:19:01	walexander	she's fine -- biggest problem w/ her eating is that she spends five minutes likcing the bowl, banging it all around
2015-07-02 16:19:07	jwong	lolol omg
2015-07-02 16:19:11	jwong	thats sasha
2015-07-02 16:19:23	jwong	fucking collar and tag banging against this metal dish of hers
2015-07-02 16:19:33	walexander	it's like, no, those aren't the jets -- they're the dog devouring her stainless steel serving dish like it was a bread bowl
2015-07-02 16:19:37	jwong	its like a tone deaf triangle players

2015-06-26 15:12:47	jwong	most of the time on chrome i see one auction go sync
2015-06-26 15:12:51	jwong	the other sees a cookie
2015-06-26 15:12:54	jwong	and goes async
2015-06-26 15:17:05	walexander	https://jsfiddle.net/9trgneqf/2/
2015-06-26 15:17:33	walexander	that's essentially what we're doing now -- and it should alert twice
2015-06-26 15:17:45	walexander	but only once -- then it throws `window.say is not a function`
2015-06-26 15:18:02	jwong	yeah line 58 has to go
2015-06-26 15:18:14	jwong	and i also proved that onSyncClear doesnt need to be unique
2015-06-26 15:18:21	jwong	the impression data is different
2015-06-26 15:20:04	walexander	no, line 75 has to change
2015-06-26 15:20:06	jwong	@jwong uploaded a file: <https://beanstock.slack.com/files/jwong/F06T33PCL/screen_shot_2015-06-26_at_12.17.43_pm.png|Screen Shot 2015-06-26 at 12.17.43 PM.png>
2015-06-26 15:20:44	jwong	thats with line 58 gone and nothing else
2015-06-26 15:21:01	walexander	yeah, but look how the second /request pixel fires *after* the first cleared
2015-06-26 15:21:36	walexander	set the delay to be like 10 seconds
2015-06-26 15:22:01	jwong	alright ill do this in a unit test
2015-06-26 16:42:14	jwong	lol
2015-06-26 18:22:20	walexander	will we send user_id and session_id on the request pixel?
2015-06-26 18:22:30	jwong	no just the cleared
2015-06-26 18:22:52	walexander	http://hive.prod.beanstock.net:8888/beeswax/execute/query/161#query/results
2015-06-26 18:23:02	walexander	requests without impressions 
2015-06-26 18:24:25	jwong	bnVsbAo= ?

2015-06-26 18:34:02	walexander	check this out: http://hive.prod.beanstock.net:8888/beeswax/execute/query/164#query/results
2015-06-26 18:35:29	walexander	bunch of those look like dupes 
2015-06-26 18:36:39	jwong	what do you mean??
2015-06-26 18:37:17	walexander	if you look at the imps for ip_address 0a99e023
2015-06-26 18:37:31	walexander	and compare teh referrer url 
2015-06-26 18:37:38	walexander	it's identical 
2015-06-26 18:37:58	walexander	no way that should be happening
2015-06-26 18:38:13	walexander	but they have distinct impression_id's
2015-06-26 18:38:34	walexander	makes me think that someone is using one APN creative to deliver multiple ads
2015-06-26 18:39:42	jwong	hmm
2015-06-26 18:39:49	walexander	http://hive.prod.beanstock.net:8888/beeswax/execute/query/164#query/results

2015-06-26 18:42:09	walexander	0a99e023 is a fucking 10.x IP 
2015-06-26 18:44:27	jwong	work computers ?

2015-06-26 18:49:22	jwong	at glance they look like it
2015-06-26 18:49:31	jwong	usually you can notice a change in sequence pretty easily

2015-06-26 18:55:09	walexander	i can't imagine they're *not* monetizing it 
2015-06-26 18:55:35	jwong	so they got APN tags
2015-06-26 18:55:42	jwong	filling somewhere on their UI
2015-06-26 18:55:55	jwong	apn is a POS lol
2015-06-26 18:56:16	jwong	or is it adshoard
2015-06-26 18:58:06	jwong	well i better start optimizing for our Amigo
2015-06-26 18:58:21	walexander	it's not adshoard
2015-06-26 21:38:04	jwong	```
2015-06-26 21:38:04		        BSM['onSyncClear'] = function(price) {
2015-06-26 21:38:04		            window.clearTimeout(timers.shift())

2015-06-26 21:38:04		        }
2015-06-26 21:38:04		```
2015-06-26 21:38:34	jwong	if we can assume that the first scheduled cleared is the earliest onSyncClear() to fire
2015-06-26 21:38:48	jwong	then i think i got it dude
2015-06-29 12:44:37	jwong	:disappointed:
2015-06-29 13:06:56	walexander	?
2015-06-29 13:07:36	jwong	nothin just saw u cancelled all the meetings
2015-06-29 13:08:11	jwong	i vaguely remember u saying something u were gonna be out on vacay during this time?

2015-07-02 16:16:36	walexander	feeding sadie these days is like caring for a geriatric patient
2015-07-02 16:17:04	jwong	she wont eat ?
2015-07-02 16:17:28	walexander	shirley's instructions: ``` SHe gets  .... 3 tramamil 1 gabapentin and 2 fish oils and the rest of the can above the sink. Mix. Serve.  ```
2015-07-02 16:17:44	walexander	hah, no, she eats just fine
2015-07-02 16:18:25	walexander	she's on these pain killers (3 tramamil) that are evidently highly regulated
2015-07-02 16:18:35	jwong	haha i just googled it
2015-07-02 16:18:38	jwong	poor girl man
2015-07-02 16:19:01	walexander	she's fine -- biggest problem w/ her eating is that she spends five minutes likcing the bowl, banging it all around
2015-07-02 16:19:07	jwong	lolol omg
2015-07-02 16:19:11	jwong	thats sasha
2015-07-02 16:19:23	jwong	fucking collar and tag banging against this metal dish of hers
2015-07-02 16:19:33	walexander	it's like, no, those aren't the jets -- they're the dog devouring her stainless steel serving dish like it was a bread bowl
2015-07-02 16:19:37	jwong	its like a tone deaf triangle players
2015-07-02 16:19:44	walexander	hahahha

2015-07-02 16:20:13	walexander	my brother got this thing to stop his dog's tags from clanking together
2015-07-02 16:20:28	jwong	its so stupid tho.. im like "oh ur still hungry" _gets more dry food_ ... then she walks away
2015-07-02 16:20:40	walexander	hahhaa, she walks away from food, eh?
2015-07-02 16:20:52	jwong	yeah bro.. unless shes real hungry
2015-07-02 16:21:07	jwong	i like the clanking, lets me know where she is.. like a cow bell
2015-07-02 16:21:20	jwong	i just wish her bowl wasnt metal
2015-07-02 16:21:26	walexander	i know -- bro's dog is like a cat all ready (super skittish)
2015-07-02 16:21:37	walexander	but I think the tags clanking were scaring it

2015-07-06 16:31:10	jwong	nice!
2015-07-06 16:31:45	walexander	Some 60s era Asian fusion shit http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2520-Entrada-Dr-Virginia-Beach-VA-23456/60741990_zpid/
2015-07-06 16:33:13	jwong	fuuuck
2015-07-06 16:33:21	jwong	this is a freakin mansion
2015-07-06 16:33:45	walexander	Its not as nice as it looks 
2015-07-06 16:33:56	jwong	bro.... 4,418 sqft ?!!
2015-07-06 16:34:02	walexander	That thing is like a time capsule from 1967
2015-07-06 16:34:06	jwong	u need golf carts
2015-07-06 16:34:32	walexander	It has an intercom system that probably looked super state of art then 
2015-07-06 16:34:54	jwong	oh god.. Keller Williams
2015-07-06 16:35:08	jwong	they are freakin everywhere
2015-07-06 16:36:52	walexander	Hehe 
2015-07-06 16:38:17	walexander	Since the value of the structure compared to the lot is so wonky, I'd have to get what's called a farmers loan 
2015-07-06 16:39:19	jwong	yeah.. wood shingles
2015-07-06 16:39:41	jwong	wood shingles eveywhere
2015-07-06 16:40:08	jwong	but that ceiling looks gorgeous dude
2015-06-26 15:06:12	walexander	we are calling BSM['onSyncClear()'] 
2015-06-26 15:06:13	jwong	but onSyncClear should be openly available to be called
2015-06-26 15:06:26	walexander	by doing that via the timeout 
2015-06-26 15:06:56	walexander	the second impression will overwrite the current's onSyncClear
2015-06-26 15:07:07	jwong	i dont think theres any harm in that though
2015-06-26 15:07:13	jwong	i think that function is generic enough
2015-06-26 15:07:20	jwong	that if we overrode it
2015-06-26 15:07:28	walexander	we call the second impressions' onSyncClear *twice* though 
2015-06-26 15:07:35	walexander	well, we call it onc3
2015-06-26 15:07:38	walexander	and hten we undef it
2015-06-26 15:07:50	jwong	yeah and i think i see that being a bigger problem as well
2015-06-26 15:07:51	walexander	so, what happens is we count the secondi mpression 
2015-06-26 15:07:55	jwong	but not hte first
2015-06-26 15:08:05	walexander	the first imp will never get counted
2015-06-26 15:08:37	jwong	if we take out line 58
2015-06-26 15:08:57	jwong	the problem becomes then that we clear with the same impression data?
2015-06-26 15:10:48	walexander	right
2015-06-26 15:12:47	jwong	most of the time on chrome i see one auction go sync
2015-06-26 15:12:51	jwong	the other sees a cookie
2015-06-26 15:12:54	jwong	and goes async

2015-06-26 15:18:21	jwong	the impression data is different
2015-06-26 15:20:04	walexander	no, line 75 has to change
2015-06-26 15:20:06	jwong	@jwong uploaded a file: <https://beanstock.slack.com/files/jwong/F06T33PCL/screen_shot_2015-06-26_at_12.17.43_pm.png|Screen Shot 2015-06-26 at 12.17.43 PM.png>
2015-06-26 15:20:44	jwong	thats with line 58 gone and nothing else
2015-06-26 15:21:01	walexander	yeah, but look how the second /request pixel fires *after* the first cleared
2015-06-26 15:21:36	walexander	set the delay to be like 10 seconds
2015-06-26 15:22:01	jwong	alright ill do this in a unit test
2015-06-26 16:42:14	jwong	lol
2015-06-26 18:22:20	walexander	will we send user_id and session_id on the request pixel?

2015-06-26 18:36:39	jwong	what do you mean??
2015-06-26 18:37:17	walexander	if you look at the imps for ip_address 0a99e023
2015-06-26 18:37:31	walexander	and compare teh referrer url 
2015-06-26 18:37:38	walexander	it's identical 
2015-06-26 18:37:58	walexander	no way that should be happening
2015-06-26 18:38:13	walexander	but they have distinct impression_id's
2015-06-26 18:38:34	walexander	makes me think that someone is using one APN creative to deliver multiple ads
2015-06-26 18:39:42	jwong	hmm
2015-06-26 18:39:49	walexander	http://hive.prod.beanstock.net:8888/beeswax/execute/query/164#query/results

2015-06-26 18:49:11	jwong	hmm
2015-06-26 18:49:22	jwong	at glance they look like it
2015-06-26 18:49:31	jwong	usually you can notice a change in sequence pretty easily

2015-06-26 18:55:09	walexander	i can't imagine they're *not* monetizing it 
2015-06-26 18:55:35	jwong	so they got APN tags
2015-06-26 18:55:42	jwong	filling somewhere on their UI
2015-06-26 18:55:55	jwong	apn is a POS lol

2015-06-26 18:58:06	jwong	well i better start optimizing for our Amigo
2015-06-26 18:58:21	walexander	it's not adshoard
2015-06-26 21:38:04	jwong	```
2015-06-26 21:38:04		        BSM['onSyncClear'] = function(price) {
2015-06-26 21:38:04		            window.clearTimeout(timers.shift())

2015-06-26 21:38:04		        }
2015-06-26 21:38:04		```
2015-06-26 21:38:34	jwong	if we can assume that the first scheduled cleared is the earliest onSyncClear() to fire
2015-06-26 21:38:48	jwong	then i think i got it dude
2015-06-29 12:44:37	jwong	:disappointed:

2015-07-02 16:16:36	walexander	feeding sadie these days is like caring for a geriatric patient
2015-07-02 16:17:04	jwong	she wont eat ?
2015-07-02 16:17:28	walexander	shirley's instructions: ``` SHe gets  .... 3 tramamil 1 gabapentin and 2 fish oils and the rest of the can above the sink. Mix. Serve.  ```
2015-07-02 16:17:44	walexander	hah, no, she eats just fine
2015-07-02 16:18:25	walexander	she's on these pain killers (3 tramamil) that are evidently highly regulated
2015-07-02 16:18:35	jwong	haha i just googled it
2015-07-02 16:18:38	jwong	poor girl man
2015-07-02 16:19:01	walexander	she's fine -- biggest problem w/ her eating is that she spends five minutes likcing the bowl, banging it all around
2015-07-02 16:19:07	jwong	lolol omg
2015-07-02 16:19:11	jwong	thats sasha
2015-07-02 16:19:23	jwong	fucking collar and tag banging against this metal dish of hers
2015-07-02 16:19:33	walexander	it's like, no, those aren't the jets -- they're the dog devouring her stainless steel serving dish like it was a bread bowl
2015-07-02 16:19:37	jwong	its like a tone deaf triangle players
2015-07-02 16:19:44	walexander	hahahha

2015-07-02 16:20:28	jwong	its so stupid tho.. im like "oh ur still hungry" _gets more dry food_ ... then she walks away
2015-07-02 16:20:40	walexander	hahhaa, she walks away from food, eh?
2015-07-02 16:20:52	jwong	yeah bro.. unless shes real hungry
2015-07-02 16:21:07	jwong	i like the clanking, lets me know where she is.. like a cow bell
2015-07-02 16:21:20	jwong	i just wish her bowl wasnt metal
2015-07-02 16:21:26	walexander	i know -- bro's dog is like a cat all ready (super skittish)
2015-07-02 16:21:37	walexander	but I think the tags clanking were scaring it

2015-07-02 16:33:41	walexander	show is based in a city called Vinci but everyone saying it's pretty clear it's meant to be Vernon

2015-07-06 16:31:10	jwong	nice!
2015-07-06 16:31:45	walexander	Some 60s era Asian fusion shit http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2520-Entrada-Dr-Virginia-Beach-VA-23456/60741990_zpid/
2015-07-06 16:33:13	jwong	fuuuck
2015-07-06 16:33:21	jwong	this is a freakin mansion
2015-07-06 16:33:45	walexander	Its not as nice as it looks 
2015-07-06 16:33:56	jwong	bro.... 4,418 sqft ?!!
2015-07-06 16:34:02	walexander	That thing is like a time capsule from 1967
2015-07-06 16:34:06	jwong	u need golf carts
2015-07-06 16:34:32	walexander	It has an intercom system that probably looked super state of art then 
2015-07-06 16:34:54	jwong	oh god.. Keller Williams
2015-07-06 16:35:08	jwong	they are freakin everywhere
2015-07-06 16:36:52	walexander	Hehe 
2015-07-06 16:38:17	walexander	Since the value of the structure compared to the lot is so wonky, I'd have to get what's called a farmers loan 
2015-07-06 16:39:19	jwong	yeah.. wood shingles
2015-07-06 16:39:41	jwong	wood shingles eveywhere
2015-07-06 16:40:08	jwong	but that ceiling looks gorgeous dude
2015-06-26 15:04:26	walexander	it will run the *second* impression's onSyncClear() 
2015-06-26 15:04:32	jwong	but if try to call it directly, the scope in which that executes doesnt find onSyncClear
2015-06-26 15:04:45	jwong	now that i think about it
2015-06-26 15:05:00	jwong	why do we need to make onSyncClear undefined?
2015-06-26 15:05:03	walexander	you can just `setTimeout(onSyncClear, interval) `
2015-06-26 15:05:48	jwong	one call to onSyncClear should be scheduled to fire regardless every time we doc write
2015-06-26 15:05:55	walexander	it's likely that `price` will be defined doing that 
2015-06-26 15:06:01	walexander	yeah, but the thing is 
2015-06-26 15:06:12	walexander	we are calling BSM['onSyncClear()'] 
2015-06-26 15:06:13	jwong	but onSyncClear should be openly available to be called
2015-06-26 15:06:26	walexander	by doing that via the timeout 
2015-06-26 15:06:56	walexander	the second impression will overwrite the current's onSyncClear
2015-06-26 15:07:07	jwong	i dont think theres any harm in that though
2015-06-26 15:07:13	jwong	i think that function is generic enough
2015-06-26 15:07:20	jwong	that if we overrode it
2015-06-26 15:07:28	walexander	we call the second impressions' onSyncClear *twice* though 
2015-06-26 15:07:35	walexander	well, we call it onc3
2015-06-26 15:07:38	walexander	and hten we undef it
2015-06-26 15:07:50	jwong	yeah and i think i see that being a bigger problem as well
2015-06-26 15:07:51	walexander	so, what happens is we count the secondi mpression 
2015-06-26 15:07:55	jwong	but not hte first
2015-06-26 15:08:05	walexander	the first imp will never get counted
2015-06-26 15:08:37	jwong	if we take out line 58
2015-06-26 15:08:57	jwong	the problem becomes then that we clear with the same impression data?
2015-06-26 15:10:48	walexander	right
2015-06-26 15:12:47	jwong	most of the time on chrome i see one auction go sync
2015-06-26 15:12:51	jwong	the other sees a cookie
2015-06-26 15:12:54	jwong	and goes async
2015-06-26 15:17:05	walexander	https://jsfiddle.net/9trgneqf/2/ --- Test your JavaScript, CSS, HTML or CoffeeScript online with JSFiddle code editor.
2015-06-26 15:17:33	walexander	that's essentially what we're doing now -- and it should alert twice
2015-06-26 15:17:45	walexander	but only once -- then it throws `window.say is not a function`
2015-06-26 15:18:02	jwong	yeah line 58 has to go
2015-06-26 15:18:14	jwong	and i also proved that onSyncClear doesnt need to be unique
2015-06-26 15:18:21	jwong	the impression data is different
2015-06-26 15:20:04	walexander	no, line 75 has to change
2015-06-26 15:20:06	jwong	@jwong uploaded a file: <https://beanstock.slack.com/files/jwong/F06T33PCL/screen_shot_2015-06-26_at_12.17.43_pm.png|Screen Shot 2015-06-26 at 12.17.43 PM.png>
2015-06-26 15:20:44	jwong	thats with line 58 gone and nothing else
2015-06-26 15:21:01	walexander	yeah, but look how the second /request pixel fires *after* the first cleared
2015-06-26 15:21:36	walexander	set the delay to be like 10 seconds
2015-06-26 15:22:01	jwong	alright ill do this in a unit test
2015-06-26 16:42:14	jwong	lol
2015-06-26 18:22:20	walexander	will we send user_id and session_id on the request pixel?
2015-06-26 18:22:30	jwong	no just the cleared

2015-06-26 21:38:34	jwong	if we can assume that the first scheduled cleared is the earliest onSyncClear() to fire

2015-07-02 16:19:01	walexander	she's fine -- biggest problem w/ her eating is that she spends five minutes likcing the bowl, banging it all around
